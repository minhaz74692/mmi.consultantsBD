        brief: "Seismic Strengthening is the modification of existing structures to make them more resistant to seismic activity, ground motion, or soil failure due to earthquakes. With better understanding of seismic demand on structures and with our recent experiences with large earthquakes near urban centers, the need of seismic retrofitting is well acknowledged. Many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out. Many technical guidelines for seismic assessment, retrofit and rehabilitation have been published around the world most of which we have in our collection.  STHAPONA CONSULTANTS LIMITED is also researching on seismic Strengthening  & providing quality  design services accordingly. "
